## Patching the game
### Fully autonomous installation (Download and install patch)
This option will autonomously download and install patch 1.27 and Rockstar Games Social Club (RGSC) version 1.1.7.8, as well as backing up your game files. The only thing you'll need to do is to validate the RGSC uninstallation and reinstallation.

### Installing patch from local files
This option will allow you to choose a folder containing your own patch.
The folder must contain these files:
- GTA5.exe
- GTAVLauncher.exe
- update.rpf
- steam_api64.dll
- Social-Club-v-1.1.7.8-Setup.exe

Just like the autonomous installation, this option will back up your game files and patch your game and RGSC.

## Restoring your previous game version
After installing patch 1.27, you will be able to go back to your previous game version using this option. Just select the "Backup_before_downgrade" folder that was previously created in your game directory. You will also need to validate the RGSC uninstallation and reinstallation.

Using this option, you'll be able to choose whether to keep your patched (1.27) game files before restoring or not. If you choose to do so, you'll have to manually install them back, as well as installing RGSC 1.1.7.8 manually.
